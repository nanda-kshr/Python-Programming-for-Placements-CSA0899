2.	Plagiarism:
o	All work must be original and completed individually. Collaboration on concepts is allowed, but each student must submit their own implementation. Plagiarism will result in a score of zero for the assignment and possible disciplinary action.
3.	Code Quality:
o	Code should be clean, well-documented, and follow proper naming conventions and coding standards. Include meaningful comments explaining the logic and purpose of each section of your code.
4.	Testing:
o	Provide comprehensive test cases demonstrating the correct functionality of your program. Include test inputs and expected outputs to validate your code thoroughly.
5.	Documentation:
o	Each assignment must include clear and comprehensive documentation. This should cover your approach, pseudocode, detailed explanation of the actual code, assumptions made, and any limitations. Additionally, include a user manual if necessary, detailing how to run and interact with the application.

Problem 1: Real-Time Weather Monitoring System
Scenario:
You are developing a real-time weather monitoring system for a weather forecasting company. The system needs to fetch and display weather data for a specified location.
Tasks:
1.	Model the data flow for fetching weather information from an external API and displaying it to the user.
2.	Implement a Python application that integrates with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data.
3.	Display the current weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
4.	Allow users to input the location (city name or coordinates) and display the corresponding weather data.
Deliverables:
•	Data flow diagram illustrating the interaction between the application and the API.
•	Pseudocode and implementation of the weather monitoring system.
•	Documentation of the API integration and the methods used to fetch and display weather data.
•	Explanation of any assumptions made and potential improvements.

Problem 2: Inventory Management System Optimization
Scenario:
You have been hired by a retail company to optimize their inventory management system. The company wants to minimize stockouts and overstock situations while maximizing inventory turnover and profitability.
Tasks:
1.	Model the inventory system: Define the structure of the inventory system, including products, warehouses, and current stock levels.
2.	Implement an inventory tracking application: Develop a Python application that tracks inventory levels in real-time and alerts when stock levels fall below a certain threshold.
3.	Optimize inventory ordering: Implement algorithms to calculate optimal reorder points and quantities based on historical sales data, lead times, and demand forecasts.
4.	Generate reports: Provide reports on inventory turnover rates, stockout occurrences, and cost implications of overstock situations.
5.	User interaction: Allow users to input product IDs or names to view current stock levels, reorder recommendations, and historical data.
Deliverables:
•	Data Flow Diagram: Illustrate how data flows within the inventory management system, from input (e.g., sales data, inventory adjustments) to output (e.g., reorder alerts, reports).
•	Pseudocode and Implementation: Provide pseudocode and actual code demonstrating how inventory levels are tracked, reorder points are calculated, and reports are generated.
•	Documentation: Explain the algorithms used for reorder optimization, how historical data influences decisions, and any assumptions made (e.g., constant lead times).
•	User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for accessing inventory information, viewing reports, and receiving alerts.
•	Assumptions and Improvements: Discuss assumptions about demand patterns, supplier reliability, and potential improvements for the inventory management system's efficiency and accuracy.

Problem 3: Real-Time Traffic Monitoring System
Scenario:
You are working on a project to develop a real-time traffic monitoring system for a smart city initiative. The system should provide real-time traffic updates and suggest alternative routes.
Tasks:
1.	Model the data flow for fetching real-time traffic information from an external API and displaying it to the user.
2.	Implement a Python application that integrates with a traffic monitoring API (e.g., Google Maps Traffic API) to fetch real-time traffic data.
3.	Display current traffic conditions, estimated travel time, and any incidents or delays.
4.	Allow users to input a starting point and destination to receive traffic updates and alternative routes.
Deliverables:
•	Data flow diagram illustrating the interaction between the application and the API.
•	Pseudocode and implementation of the traffic monitoring system.
•	Documentation of the API integration and the methods used to fetch and display traffic data.
•	Explanation of any assumptions made and potential improvements.

Problem 4: Real-Time COVID-19 Statistics Tracker
Scenario:
You are developing a real-time COVID-19 statistics tracking application for a healthcare organization. The application should provide up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths for a specified region.
Tasks:
1.	Model the data flow for fetching COVID-19 statistics from an external API and displaying it to the user.
2.	Implement a Python application that integrates with a COVID-19 statistics API (e.g., disease.sh) to fetch real-time data.
3.	Display the current number of cases, recoveries, and deaths for a specified region.
4.	Allow users to input a region (country, state, or city) and display the corresponding COVID-19 statistics.
Deliverables:
•	Data flow diagram illustrating the interaction between the application and the API.
•	Pseudocode and implementation of the COVID-19 statistics tracking application.
•	Documentation of the API integration and the methods used to fetch and display COVID-19 data.
